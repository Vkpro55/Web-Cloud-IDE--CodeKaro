**What is node-pty?**

node-pty is a Node.js package that allows you to spawn and manage pseudo-terminals (PTYs). It enables your web-based cloud IDE to run terminal commands, shell processes, or even interactive REPL environments inside a browser or application.

Key Features of node-pty:

- Run Shell Commands – Execute Linux, macOS, or Windows commands.
- Interactive Terminal – Handle real-time input/output like a real terminal.
- Cross-Platform – Works on Windows (via PowerShell, CMD, Git Bash) and Unix-based systems (Linux/macOS).
- Better Performance – More efficient than Node's default child_process for terminal-like applications.
- Integrate with Web IDEs – Allows creating VS Code-like web terminals.

**How node-pty Helps in a Web Cloud IDE:**

If you're building a Cloud IDE like CodeKaro, node-pty can be used for:

- Embedded Terminal – Provide users with a real-time terminal in their browser.
- Execute Build Commands – Run npm, yarn, pip, docker, git inside your IDE.
- Remote Code Execution – Allow running scripts securely on a backend server.
- Real-Time Output – Stream logs/output back to the client UI (e.g., using Socket.io)

**Aim:**

- Handles the request when a user wants to create a new playground.
- Spawns a Docker container dynamically with the required environment.
- Returns the container's IP address so the user can access their instance.
- A new Docker instance is spawned.
- The user is assigned a unique terminal session inside the container.
- The IP of the container is returned for the user to connect.
